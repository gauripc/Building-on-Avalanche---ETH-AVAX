# Degen Token (DEGEN) Smart Contract

## Overview

The Degen Token (DEGEN) is a simple ERC-20 compatible token implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows for token minting, burning, and transferring, along with a custom redeem function for specific game items.

## Token Details

- Name: DEGEN
- Symbol: DGN
- Decimals: 18
- Total Supply: [totalSupply]

## Smart Contract Functions

### Mint

The `mint` function allows the contract owner to create new tokens and assign them to a specific address.

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public
```

Parameters:
- `to`: The address to receive the minted tokens.
- `amount`: The amount of tokens to mint.

### Burn

The `burn` function allows token holders to destroy a specified amount of their tokens, reducing the total supply.

```solidity
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) public
```

Parameters:
- `from`: The address from which tokens will be burned.
- `amount`: The amount of tokens to burn.

### Transfer

The `transfer` function enables token holders to send tokens to another address.

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public
```

Parameters:
- `to`: The address to receive the transferred tokens.
- `amount`: The amount of tokens to transfer.

### Redeem

The `redeem` function allows token holders to exchange their tokens for specific in-game items. Different items require different minimum token amounts.

```solidity
function redeem(address to, uint256 amount, uint256 gameItem) public
```

Parameters:
- `to`: The address redeeming tokens.
- `amount`: The amount of tokens to redeem.
- `gameItem`: The identifier for the desired in-game item (1, 2, 3).

## Usage

To deploy the Degen Token smart contract, deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Remix or Truffle. After deployment, interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or scripts.

**Note:** Ensure you have the required permissions to mint tokens (owner-only) and that token holders have sufficient balance for burning and redemption.
